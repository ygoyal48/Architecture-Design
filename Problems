1. Setup MySQL and write a code to understand the following constraints - 
   NOT_NULL
   UNIQUE
   PRIMARY KEY
   FOREIGN KEY
   CHECK
   DEFAULT
   AUTO_INCREMENT

2. There is a table(T1) which has a column(C1) which refrences another table's(T2) column(C2). 
   What happens when we try to add values to T1 such that the value being inserted in C1 does not exist in C2?

3. Try to alter a table's column and add AUTO_INCREMENT to a column later. What value does the next insert pick for that given column?
4. What happens if we delete a row from a table having AUTO_INCREMENT contraint on a column? Will it rearrange the numbering?
5. How can I add on delete cascade constraint on an existing column of a table?
6. How does on delete cascade works?
7. What does SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name do?
8. How do transactions work in MySQL? 
9. Experiment with all isolation levels for the transactions.
10. Do we need to set isolation level per transaction or per session? --> per transaction
11. How does locking work in SERIALIZABLE isolation level?
12. How can we backup and restore database using mysqldump?
13. Does this backup take care of the column values such as NOW();
