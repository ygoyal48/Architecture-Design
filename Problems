1. Setup MySQL and write a code to understand the following constraints - 
   NOT_NULL
   UNIQUE
   PRIMARY KEY
   FOREIGN KEY
   CHECK
   DEFAULT
   AUTO_INCREMENT

2. There is a table(T1) which has a column(C1) which refrences another table's(T2) column(C2). 
   What happens when we try to add values to T1 such that the value being inserted in C1 does not exist in C2?

3. Try to alter a table's column and add AUTO_INCREMENT to a column later. What value does the next insert pick for that given column?
4. What happens if we delete a row from a table having AUTO_INCREMENT contraint on a column? Will it rearrange the numbering?
5.
